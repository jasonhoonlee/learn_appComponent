About:
This is one component of the Web App "Book of Dogs".


Purpose:
Dogs differ a lot in personality depending on their breed.

This component provides profiles of almost 200 dog breeds.
As a result, new dog owners can educate themselves on what breed is best for them.

The goal of this component is to move browsing prospects over to the listings page to view actual dogs in their area.
